# Human Resource Management System (HRMS)

This is a Java-based console application simulating a basic human resource management system.  
It allows the addition, listing, searching, and deletion of employee records using data structures and object-oriented design principles.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Custom Data Structures (Linked List, Binary Search Tree)

---

## 📦 Features

- Add new employees via console input  
- Display all employees in the system  
- Search for employees by ID using a Binary Search Tree  
- Delete employees by ID using a Linked List  
- Console-based menu-driven interaction  

---

## 🧩 Data Structures Used

- **Linked List**: Stores the list of employees in insertion order  
- **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Allows fast lookup of employee by ID
